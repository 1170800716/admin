### Prepare for visa application (optional) ðŸ›‚

A quick way to check if you may need a visa is to enter `wiki visa requirements
for [your country here] citizens` into a search engine. The first result is typically a
wikipedia page with a table of all countries' visa policy that would apply to you.

If you need a visa, don't worry! You can still apply for travel funds. You'll need
to account for extra time to prepare your visa application, apply for the visa,
and receive it before the date of travel.

We've provided here a checklist of items that a visa application could require.
Thinking about how long it will take you to prepare these will give you an idea of how
long it could take to prepare your visa application.

Typical visa applications may ask for any or all of the following:

* An original passport. If you don't have one, you'll need to apply for one first.
Check with your passport issuing authority for the processing time.
* Passport-sized photos.
* An original proof of residency for the country where you live,
assuming you are not a citizen. For example, if you live in Canada this could be
a Permanent Residence Card or a Temporary Residence Visa.
* Copies of any of the above documents.
* A copy of your air ticket.
* A copy of your accommodation reservations.
* Proof of travel insurance.
* A fee for processing your application.
* An invitation letter. If it's an event hosted by the Foundation, you can just use
https://events.linuxfoundation.org/visa-request/ to get a letter. For Collaboration
Summits, contact Foundation staff.

For the actual requirements, check the website of the consulate of the country to
which you will be traveling.

Check the visa application processing time and plan accordingly.

In some cases, a visitor or tourism visa is what you need. In other cases, you may
need a business visa. Check the visa policy on the consulate website for what you
will need.

You may need to prove that you have a stable income and strong ties to your country
of residence. Proof can take many forms, such as bank statements, letters from
an employer, and documents certified by a notary public. See the relevant visa requirements
for their preferences.

The consulate may not be in the city where you live; you'll need to check how you
can apply. In some cases, you can apply online or by post. In others, your application
may need a face-to-face interview at the consulate. Please factor this into your
plans.
